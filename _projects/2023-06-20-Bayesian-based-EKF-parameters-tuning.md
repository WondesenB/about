A new method for tuning noise in UAV AHRS estimation uses Bayesian optimization for fast, efficient improvements. By adjusting scaling factors of noise matrices, it efficiently optimizes for high-dimensional systems. Performance tests show significant improvement with this method, which is widely applicable to AHRS applications.
