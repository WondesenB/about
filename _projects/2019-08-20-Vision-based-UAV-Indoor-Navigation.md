**Drone navigates indoors without GPS:** This project equipped a drone with stereo cameras, lidar, and ultrasonic sensors to navigate autonomously in GPS-denied environments. Cameras + lidar + IMU helped track the drone's location, while ultrasonic sensors scanned for obstacles. The project even upgraded to fly through windows, using YOLO3 for object detection and obstacle avoidance.
